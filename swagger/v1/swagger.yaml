                  years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is
                  to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most
                  serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life
                  has he looked away - to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind
                  on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement.
